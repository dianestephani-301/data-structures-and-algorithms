## Multi-Bracket Validation

For this challenge, I worked with Joe Pennock. Given a string, we needed to make sure that each opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket of the same type. To achieve this, we implemented a Stack class. We used the split method to turn the string into an array of substrings for each character, and then used the push method to push opening brackets into the Stack, and popped off closing brackets.
