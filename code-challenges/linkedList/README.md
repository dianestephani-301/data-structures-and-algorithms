# Singly Linked List

## Challenge
Add a new node to the head of a linked list.

## Approach and Efficiency
Collaborated with Joe, Ben, Chris, Davee, Edgar, and Sarah. Created a constructor for each node, then a method that inserted a new node and traversed through the rest of the list to reassign values accordingly.
