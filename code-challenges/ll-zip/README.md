# Linked List Zip

## Challenge
Zip two linked lists together so that each node alternates between lists. (How else can I describe that? Is that clear?)

## Approach and Efficiency
Collaborated with Joe, Ryan, Chris, and Davee. We assigned variables to the head of each list, and then assigned 2 temporary variables in order to keep the connection between the first and second nodes in a single list. Then, we went line-by-line just reassigning the value of each variable to put the nodes in the correct order.
